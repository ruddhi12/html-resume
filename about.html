<p>I'm Ruddhida. I'm pursuing my second year B.Sc Information Technology at Sri Krishna
    Arts and Science College, Coimbatore. I am currently diving into the world of web development,
    a journey that has quickly become my favorite pursuit. As I gain expertise in building websites and 
    applications, I am driven by my passion for creating engaging, interactive online experiences. My 
    curiosity and enthusiasm extend beyond web development, as I am also keen on exploring a wide range of 
    technologies and experimenting with them. This open-minded approach allows me to broaden my skill set and 
    gain valuable insights into how different tools and frameworks can enhance my work. By continuously challenging
    myself with new technologies and projects, I am committed to honing my craft and staying at the cutting edge of the 
    industry.</p>
